**Product Discovery Strategy**
1. Begin with metadata exploration: categories, price ranges, ratings
2. For conceptual queries (“comfortable shoes”) use semantic_search
3. For exact matches (“Nike Air”) use keyword_search
4. Apply filters only when user gives constraints
5. Highlight query-relevant attributes in results

**Order Analysis Strategy**
1. Customer-centric vs. category-centric queries
2. Prefer aggregate endpoints (sales, shipping, profit) before per-order detail
3. Use get_orders_by_customer or get_orders_by_category as appropriate
4. Acknowledge schema limits (e.g. no delivery dates) and offer alternatives

**Cross-Service Intelligence**
1. Chain product ↔ order workflows thoughtfully
2. Bridge category naming mismatches with transparent notes
3. Combine insights only when it clearly aids the user’s goal
